#  displayDice (dice)
#
#  The list dice contains the results of most recent roll of the dice.
#
#  The function displayDie prints out the number rolled for each individual die.
#
#  In the future, this function could be replaced with a more visual
#  representation of dice.

#  The list dice contains the results of most recent roll of the dice.
#
#  This function simulates a possible reroll of the dice: the user is prompted
#  for which dice should be kept and which should be re-rolled.
#
#  This function makes use of the function yesOrNo, which must be written.
#

#  rollAllDice (dice)
#
#  This function simulates the rolling portion of a turn, returning
#  the final values in the list dice.
#
#  Initially, all dice are rolled.  The results are displayed, and
#  the user is given the option to re-roll at most twice (for a total
#  of three rolls).
#
#  This function makes use of the functions yesOrNo and reroll, both 
#  of which must be written.

#  main -- the heart of the program 
#
#  There are two arrays here:
#
#      dice[5], which contains the results of a turn's dice roll
#         (e.g., each dice[i] is the roll of a separate die)
#
#      freq[7]: indicates how many dice came up with a given value
#          freq[1] is the number of ones rolled
#          freq[2] is the number of twos rolled
#               etc.
#
#      Example: Suppose the dice rolled were  5 3 6 6 2
#          dice[0] = 5   dice[1] = 3   dice[2] = 6   etc
#
#          freq[1] = freq[4] = 0   freq[5] = freq[3] = freq[2] = 1
#          freq[6] = 2

    dice = [0]*5    # dice[i] is the value on die #i
    freq = [0]*7    # freq[v] is how many dice came up with value v

    #    (keep next line commented out if you don't)
    # seed (12345678)
